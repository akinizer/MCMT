    *   Typically: `C:\Users\[YourUserName]\Games\Age of Mythology Retold\<SteamID>\mods\local\data\`
2.  **Copy the `mcmt` folder** (the folder containing this README and all mod files) into the `local` directory.
    *   The final path should look like: `...\mods\local\mcmt\`
3.  **Launch Age of Mythology: Retold.**
4.  **Enable the mod** from the in-game mod manager.

## How Content is Accessed

Most new units and technologies are integrated into the game via the "MCMT_Techs" master technology. This master tech is automatically granted to all civilizations as the signature of Cyber Age.

*   **New Units:** Many new units are enabled directly by `MCMT_SpecialUnits` (a sub-tech of `MCMT_Techs`). They will typically be trainable from appropriate existing buildings (e.g., Town Center, Barracks, Temple) or new custom buildings like the Bastion, Temple of Primordials, or Strategic Vessel Assembly.
*   **New Researches:** New technologies become available for research in relevant buildings (e.g., Armory, Market, Temple, or the new `TechBuilding`) once `MCMT_Researches` (a sub-tech of `MCMT_Techs`) is active.
*   **Unit Command Panels:** Special units like Landlord and Conan have multi-page command panels, activated by researching `MCMT_Page1` and `MCMT_Page2` (which are made obtainable by `MCMT_UnitAccelPanels`, another sub-tech of `MCMT_Techs`).

## Compatibility

*   This mod extensively modifies `techtree_mods.xml`, `proto_mods.xml`, `abilities_mods.xml`, and `powers_mods.xml`.
*   It is likely to conflict with other mods that significantly alter these core game data files or introduce a large number of new units/techs in a similar manner.
*   Mods that only change textures, sounds, or make minor balance adjustments might be compatible.
*   Always back up your game files or use a mod manager that handles conflicts if you plan to use multiple large mods.

## Known Issues

*   Due to the large number of additions, some balance aspects may require further tuning.
